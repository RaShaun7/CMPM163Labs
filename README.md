For the left bottom, I applied a green specular on the cube and added shininess.
For the left top, I applied a green specular, blue emissive, some shininess, lowered its opacity, and made it able to be transparent.
For the bottom right, I made a vertex shader that keeps the position of the shape and a fragment shader to color the cube. I passed grey-blue and green-blue through the shader as parameter and had the frag color line be an interpolation between these two colors.
For the top right, I made a vertex shader that keeps the position of the shape and a fragment shader to color the cube. I passed yellow and pink through the shader as parameter and had the frag color line be an interpolation between these two colors.
