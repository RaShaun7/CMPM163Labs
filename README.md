For the left bottom, I applied a green specular on the cube and added shininess.

For the left top, I applied a green specular, blue emissive, some shininess, lowered its opacity, and made it able to be transparent.

For the bottom right, I made a vertex shader that keeps the position of the shape and a fragment shader to color the cube. I passed grey-blue and green-blue through the shader as parameter and had the frag color line be an interpolation between these two colors.

For the top right, I made a vertex shader that keeps the position of the shape and a fragment shader to color the cube. I passed yellow and pink through the shader as parameter and had the frag color line be an interpolation between these two colors.

For the first cube it uses three.js built infunctionality and a texture to color the cube face.
For the second cube it uses three.js built in functionality and colors over a normal map we included with the same texture to color the cube face.
For the third cube it uses three.js built in functionality and colors over a new normal map we included with a new texture to color the cube face.
For the fourth cube it uses shaders we made and a texture to color the cube face.

The particle system was modified to be orange by changing the start color.
The wheel colors were changed to blue and green by giving them new materials.
The checkpoints were changed to red by giving them new materials.
